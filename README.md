## Where did this project come from?

At Stevenson Elementary, classes rotate through "specialist" classes such as Art, Library, and Computer Science throughout the week. At each rotation, a class can earn up to 5 "Stars" for good behavior.

To incentivize good behavior for the 2023-2024 school year, Stevenson Specialists decided to collectively track classes earning 4 or 5 stars and enter them into a monthly drawing for a prize. They also hoped that analyzing this data across multiple "specialist" classes might reveal trends in class behavior, or identify a specific specialist that might be able to encourage good behavior in other specialists' classes.

To facilitate data tracking and analysis, the Stevenson specialists requested an app to automatically track and compile these results.


## How do I use this app?

**This app was designed with the intention to be perpetually free and re-usable by teachers in similar situations**

To keep all of the app free, it requires two parts:

1. A Google Form to Collect Data

2. [This App](https://spammusubi153.github.io/AwardPicker/) to Process Data

**To use this app:**

1. Create a free Google Form with two questions: One "Multiple Choice" question that requests the name of the Specialist, and another "Checkbox" question with a list of visiting classes.

2. Share the form link with the other specialists in your team, and fill out the form throughout each month.

3. At the end of each month, download the form as a CSV file under File > Download > Comma Separated Values (.csv)

4. Navigate to the app at https://spammusubi153.github.io/AwardPicker/

5. Upload the spreadsheet you downloaded and enjoy your data!

## Who made this app?

This app was made by [Max](https://www.linkedin.com/in/max-t-33662a209/), a programmer who is really interested in creating and training Machine Learning (ML) networks. He also enjoys trying new projects such as this one, which require programming to be used in different ways. He is currently at college, and would be excited to hear of any Machine Learning opportunities you wish to share. Additionally, if you happen to be a teacher in the Seattle area that needs a program involving machine learning, or an app similar to this one, try contacting him. He will attempt to respond if he is able to.

This app was originally intended to be a short project, but grew in scale and complexity over the span of a few days. Without a local Jekyll developing environment, the entire app was created and debugged using GitHub pages. The development history is available in this repository.
